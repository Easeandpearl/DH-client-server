The project aims to establish secure communication between a server and a client
using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm and AES encryption. The Diffie-Hellman
algorithm allows the server and client to securely exchange a session key, which is then
used to encrypt and decrypt messages exchanged during the communication session.
The Java codes DHClient.java, DHServer.java, and DHClientGUI.java have been
developed to implement this functionality.
The project utilizes Java's socket programming to facilitate communication between the
server and client. The server code (DHServer.java) runs on the server side, while the
client code (DHClient.java) can be executed on the client side. Additionally,
DHClientGUI.java provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for the client side, making it
more user-friendly
